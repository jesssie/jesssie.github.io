    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        We made a number of changes to our site towards the end of the process, mostly due to time constraints. 
        The most obvious of these changes is the severe reduction in the number of categories compared to the planned 
        number. With an intention to have somewhere between five and eight different categories, we ended with three. 
        Honestly, we chose three because it feels like the minimum number required to make a drop down appear worth it. 
        We were running out of time to actually populate the site with song pages because the templates' css's were giving 
        us a hard time, so the fewer pages we had to make the better. This is also why only one of the song pages has 
        notation. Alice the Camel is our example of what a song should look like in it's final state. The notation button 
        displays actual notation, and the version links direct you to the alternate versions. The version functionality 
        is merely commented out for all the other songs, in case we ever add alternate versions.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Another dropped feature is the Search page. The search function is right know a link to the featured 
        page, but it's supposed to link to a search page where the user can actually search the site for a title, 
        but we didnt manage to finish it due to a lack of time. We likely would have used Google search plugins.</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        A feature that was only ever planned as a stretch goal was going to be the implementation of a listening 
        system. Underneath the Notation button, but over the versions drop down was going to be a Listen button. 
        This was going to play a sound file of the song being sung using some sort of mp3 plugin, but was obviously 
        abandoned as the deadline approached it's realization.</p>
